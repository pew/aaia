# A as in Alpha

Python 3 Flask app to output the NATO phonetic alphabet with given input. [A sample is available here](https://peaceful-chamber-42873.herokuapp.com/). Might come in handy when you need to spell something out over the phone.

# Installation

You might want to install this within a `virtualenv`

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

A local webserver will start on port `5000`. You can also just push it to heroku.

# Usage

Just start typing and hit return or the *submit* button. Since we're in 2016 you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser! I plan to add a non-js version though. Maybe.

# Todo

Lot's of stuff.
